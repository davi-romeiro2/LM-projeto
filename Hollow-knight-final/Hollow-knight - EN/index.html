        <h2>Lore</h2>

        <p>
            The story of Hollow Knight is told in a fragmented manner, and it is up to the player to discover and interpret the details. In summary, the game takes place in the underground kingdom of Hallownest, which was once a prosperous and vibrant place but is now in ruins and filled with hostile creatures. The Hollow Knight is one of the characters who inhabit this world and embarks on a journey to uncover what happened to the kingdom and attempt to restore it.

            Throughout the game, the player encounters various characters who help to tell the story of Hallownest. It is revealed that the kingdom was dominated by a being called "The Radiance," who sought to control a material known as the "Scarab Beetle," which had powerful magical properties. However, this power ended up corrupting The Radiance and causing a series of catastrophic events that led to the downfall of Hallownest.

            The player must explore different areas of the kingdom, facing challenging enemies and bosses to collect powers and abilities that allow them to progress in previously inaccessible areas. In the end, the Hollow Knight confronts The Radiance in an epic battle to determine the fate of Hallownest. The story has several twists and turns and an exciting ending that depends on the player's choices.

            <h2>Game-Review</h2>

            <p>
                I, as a writer and creator of this site, have completed Hollow Knight multiple times, achieving all the game's endings (including the Godmaster DLC), and I can confidently say that Hollow Knight does its job very well and is one of the best Metroidvania-style games I have ever played, or perhaps even the best game I have ever played. Nonetheless, there are still positive and negative points that I would like to mention here.
            </p>

            <h3>Positive Points:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>- It is highly replayable due to the different alternate endings, secrets, and various game modes.</li>
                <li>- It features a fragmented and rich story that is enjoyable to uncover.</li>
                <li>- The gameplay is smooth and the graphics are pleasing.</li>
                <li>- The game has characters with intriguing backstories and depth.</li>
                <li>- The controls and gameplay are easy to pick up.</li>
                <li>- The soundtrack is also noteworthy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Negative Points:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>- With its vast map, the game's traversal can sometimes become repetitive and tedious.</li>
                <li>- It's not uncommon to feel lost in the midst of the game.</li>
                <li>- The initial playthrough can be confusing.</li>
                <li>- Additionally, some of the in-game noises and sounds may be discomforting.</li>
